As biologists discover and learn to embrace the complexity of biological systems, computational data analysis and modeling have become critical for furthering our understanding. Exascale computing will enable the development of new predictive multiscale models, transforming how we study the behaviors of organisms and ecosystems, ultimately leading to new innovations and discoveries.
